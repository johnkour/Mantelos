# Mantelos
This repository contains machine learning algorithms in Python to handle the data produced by the Master's Thesis of Michalis Mantelos.

1) In the folder **Logistic regression** there is a binary classifier implemented with the aid of **sklearn**.
2) In the folder **3 Layer NN** there is a three layer Deep Neural Network with 11 hidden units that was constructed with the aid of TensorFlow.

There are several parts of the code in this repository that were provided by **deeplearning.ai**.
I am very greatful to them and please chech them out.
